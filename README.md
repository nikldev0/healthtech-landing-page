 ## Things learnt/practiced:

1. Bootstrap classes. 
2. Designing from a spec (i.e. modelling a design).
3. Keyframe animations.

## Challenges I overcame:

1. Making the carousel responsive was the trickest part of this project as it often broke on smaller screens, this was a CSS issue and was resolved by carefully altering the padding and margin for smaller devices.
